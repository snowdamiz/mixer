# willResignActiveNotification

A notification that posts when the app is no longer active and loses focus.

```
nonisolated class let willResignActiveNotification: NSNotification.Name
```

## Discussion

An app is active when it is receiving events. An active app can be said to have focus. It gains focus after being launched, loses focus when an overlay window pops up or when the device is locked, and gains focus when the device is unlocked.
